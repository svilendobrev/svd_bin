i use these as linking vcs.sh to 'v' and also to 'u'.
so 'v' does it all, and 'u' is a shortcut to 'v u'.
e.g. 'u -r myrevision' and 'v i -m "commit it"'. 
if the shell doesnot remember 1-letter commands, all the better.
colorvcs.py supplements it nicely but isn't required.

if u need uall.sh to walk across symbolic links, rename/link it as luall.sh

for all else, read the source, dear...
