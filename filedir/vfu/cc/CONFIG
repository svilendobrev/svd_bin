  VFU CONFIGURATION, OPTIONS AND CACHE FILES LOCATIONS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  By default VFU searches these locations for `vfu.conf' config file:
 
  1. personal vfu.conf ( explained below )
  2. /etc/
  3. /usr/local/etc/
  4. /usr/local/
 
  The personal vfu.conf is located in `$HOME/.vfu/' directory and it is
  created if not exist. The same directory is used for keeping options
  and cache files ( directory tree, history, options, etc. )
 
  Well, More than 1/3 of all files in my home directory are various
  configuration ( dotfiles -> `.name' ) files for many applications
  ( and directories as well ). I think that if all these files/dirs
  are moved to `$HOME/etc/' or `$HOME/.conf/' or similar directory,
  the home directory will look a lot more clean. I know that dotfiles
  are considered `hidden' but I'd like to see all files w/o such
  restrictions. I also know that keeping configs in `$HOME/.name'
  files is usual since the beginning, but it doesn't help.
 
  So a simple solution to this problem is to check for exported
  environment variable called `RC_PREFIX' and if found to check
  for config files in `$HOME/$RC_PREFIX/.name' ( where `.name'
  is the config file or dir ). Is $RC_PREFIX is not defined all
  configs will go as usual in the `$HOME/.name'.
 
  VFU works in this way and I have got always $RC_PREFIX defined
  to `etc' ( i.e. vfu.conf goes in `$HOME/etc/.vfu/' ).
 
  I don't know if there is similar idea already, but if you like it
  it would be nice if your own programs support this option. Of 
  cource if you don't like the name RC_PREFIX you can use other like
  CONFIG_PREFIX for example.
