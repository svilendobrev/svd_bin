  This is preliminary documentation to the `RX_*' utilities.
  The main purpose of rx_* is to provide standard archive-like
  interface to various containers (archives, ftp sites, etc). 
  It is mainly used with VFU file manager which can be found 
  at http://cade.datamax.bg/vfu.

  `FTP' archives contain just info how to connect to the
  required site.
  
  example1:
  
  text file named: soul.ftp
  ---cut---
  soul.tetida.org
  cade
  secretpassword
  ---cut---
  
  command line: 
    
    rx_auto v soul.ftp /pub
    
  will show all files in the `/pub' directory at the FTP site 
  soul.tetida.org. you can use dash `-' as username and password
  to mimic anonymous access:
  
  example2:
  
  text file named: cade.jane.org
  ---cut---
  jane.tetida.org
  -
  -
  ---cut---  
  
  command line:
  
    rx_ftp x cade.jane.ftp pub/welcome.txt
    
  will extract/download welcome.txt file from he pub directory at
  the jane.tetida.org FTP site. username will be `anonymouse' and
  password will be `current_username@current_hostname' (from the
  environment)
