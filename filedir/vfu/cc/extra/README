  This directory contains some extra files,
  not (directly) related to the VFU project
 
 
  Xmodmap     is a modmap file that enables
              keypad keys as arrows/home/end
              etc...
 
  vga.pcf     is my favorite font for rxvt
              (xterm)
 
  Rxvt        is my configuration for rxvt
              (/var/X11R6/lib/app-defaults/Rxvt)
              OBSOLETE: see Xdefaults
 
  vfu-bash    is a bash function that enables
              vfu to change working directory
              on exit, to merge with your
              current environment you have to:
              . ./vfu-bash
              note the leading dot!

  Xdefaults   contains some fixes to allow easier
              VFU usage under X (mostly rxvt issues)
