  NOTE: THIS IS OPTIONAL, YOU SHOULD USE THIS ONLY IF YOU HAVE
        PROBLEMS WITH STANDARD TERMINFO ENTRIES (linux,linux*,rxvt...)

  If you want to use this terminfo/termcap definition:
 
  1. copy `linux-c2' file to /usr/share/terminof/l/
  2. export TERM=linux-c2
     (for bash)
  3. run vfu
 
  or
 
  1. compile linux-c2.terminfo.src:
     tic linux-c2.terminfo.src -o .
  2. you should got linux-c2 file in ./l/ directory
  3. proceed as above

  This works fine with linux console and rxvt (xterm works also).
 
  If you have found bugs in linux-c2 or you have any notes
  about this file, feel free to contact me <cade@biscom.net>
  I'll be glad to help you or to fix/update linux-c2.
