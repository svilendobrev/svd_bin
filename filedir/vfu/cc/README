   VF File Manager for Unix/Linux ( VFU )

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
   Please if you use or evaluate VFU send me a message with something
   like `I'm using/evaluating VFU' at <cade@biscom.net>. I'd like to
   have rough idea how many users VFU has.
 
						Thank you in advance!

   WARNING
   
        Make sure you removed all old personal config and cache files
        before new version install! Usually this means you have to
        remove or rename ~/.vfu directory.

   NOTE
 
        This file was a vfu documentation file once, now it is split
        into separated files ( INSTALL, HISTORY, FAQ, TODO, etc... )
