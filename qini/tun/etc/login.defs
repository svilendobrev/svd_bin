# Login configuration initializations:
#
#	UMASK		Default "umask" value.
#
# UMASK is the default umask value for pam_umask and is used by
# useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.
#
# If USERGROUPS_ENAB is set to "yes", that will modify this UMASK default value
# for private user groups, i. e. the uid is the same as gid, and username is
# the same as the primary group name: for these, the user permissions will be
# used as group permissions, e. g. 022 will become 002.
#
# Prefix these values with "0" to get octal, "0x" to get hexadecimal.
#
#UMASK		022
UMASK		002

#
# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# If set to yes, userdel will remove the userÂ´s group if it contains no
# more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name
# of the user.

USERGROUPS_ENAB yes
