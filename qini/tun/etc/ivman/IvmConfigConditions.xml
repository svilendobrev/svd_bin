    <!-- general syntax of this file:

         <ivm:Match name="matchname" value="matchvalue">
             <ivm:Condition name="conditionname1" exec="command1" />
             <ivm:Condition name="conditionname2" exec="command2" />
         </ivm:Match>

         What does this actually mean?  Well, when a device emits a condition,
         if the device matches the 'Match' tag AND 'conditionname1'
         matches the name of the condition, then 'command1' will be
         executed.

         Matches can be nested.  See the examples.

         If a condition matches multiple times, all matching commands will be
         executed.

    <!-- names for Match:    

         ivm.mountable (true/false) - a volume which can be mounted by ivman
         hal.anything (mixed) - the HAL property specified by 'anything'
         * - always match (use with care!)

         The hal.anything match is very powerful; see the examples in this
         file for some things which can be done.  Use the output of 'lshal'
         to come up with properties to match for certain devices.
    -->

    <!-- commands can have any HAL properties placed within them by surrounding
         the property name with $ symbols, for example, $hal.block.device$.
    -->

    <!-- Shut down when power button is pressed.  This and the rest of the ACPI
         stuff needs HAL 0.5 or better to work.  Also, /sbin/shutdown needs to be
	 in /etc/sudoers for whatever user Ivman runs as. -->
