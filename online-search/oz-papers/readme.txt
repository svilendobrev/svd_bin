main idea:
 as online search/filter engines are usualy too stupid, rely on them just
 to narrow the information to downloadable/processable quantities;
1- do a query (dont narrow too much - all cars for the region, price below
   10000 is enough); see how the next/prev URLs are coded;
2- create a html to point to ALL the pages of that query (and some more just in case);
3- then give it to some web-downloader (teleport, webcopy, wget, whatever)
   so it will download everything from the website of the newspaper for the
   rough filter of things you search for
4- combine the result and apply simple filtering (no ad's, images, forms, etc)
5- apply the findit.pl deriven filters to get what you want

after steps 1&2 (and partialy 5) are done once, next 3,4,5 take
exactly 5 minutes to get last info, filter it, print the interesting things;
saves money, paper and eyes
